gemspec

# Declare any dependencies that are still in development here instead of in
# your gemspec. These might include edge Rails or gems from your path or
# Git. Remember to move these dependencies to your gemspec before releasing
# your gem to rubygems.org.

# To use a debugger
# gem 'byebug', group: [:development, :test]

# For development
# group :development do
#   gem 'devise'
#   gem "jquery-rails"

#   gem "pry"
# end

# To run tests
